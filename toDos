Next Steps to Get Started:
Begin with the authentication system in Phase 1
Create a project board to track implementation progress
Set up a development branch for each phase
Establish regular code reviews and testing milestones
This phased approach allows you to make incremental improvements while maintaining a functional system throughout the development process.
